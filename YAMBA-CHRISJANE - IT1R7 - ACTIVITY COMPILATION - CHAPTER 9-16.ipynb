Since the time a car spends in the wash bay is measured in minutes, we might as well measure waiting times and the time that the car wash is open (the length of the day) in minutes as well.

This also means that the average time between two arrivals is ½ minute; we call this interarrival time.The time cashier takes to serve one customer is called service time. This too changes from customer to customer and is, therefore, variable and uncertain. Let us say, on average, service time for a customer is 15 seconds = ¼ minute. This also means that the one cashier can serve customers at the rate of 1/(1/4) = 4 customers per minute; this is what we call service rate (symbol mu ).Since there is only one cashier, number of cashiers is 1. We use symbol m for this. In case cafe opens another cashier and if a single line is used to feed both servers, we will say number of servers m is 2. \n",
